Oesophageal cancer is a major health concern with a few effective target therapies and low survival rates. This disease is responsible for the death of estimated 400,000 people annually worldwide. Oesophageal cancer can be subdivided histologically into two primary types, adenocarcinoma (EAC), which occurs in the lower part of the oesophagus, and squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), which occurs predominantly in the upper and middle part of the oesophagus. EAC is usually associated with gastric reflux and obesity, while ESCC is associated with alcohol use and smoking.

 

In this study, 164 oesophageal carcinomas were analyzed on the molecular level, for a better categorization of the tumors and identification of new potential therapies. The tumor samples and genetic materials were taken from patients from several countries who weren’t exposed to radiation or chemotherapy. Their DNA was subjected to multiple molecular analysis including whole-exome-sequencing and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). The bioinformatics analysis revealed different genetic expressions.

 

In EACs, ARF6 and FOXA pathways were upregulated, hence an increase in E-cadherin (CDH1) signaling was observed. Upregulation was exhibited in ESCCs also, specifically in Wnt and p63 pathways. ESCCs also showed frequent amplification of genes related to cell cycle regulation such as CCDN1, SOX2 and TP63. Whereas EACs demonstrated frequent amplifications in some genes involved in cancer progression like ERBB2, VEGTA, GATA4 and GATA6. The observed data showed distinguished molecular characteristics between ESCCs and EACs and encourages development of new target therapies specific to each type.

 

In conclusion, the integrated genomic characterization of oesophageal carcinoma reveals significant molecular differences between EAC and ESCC, suggesting that they should be considered distinct entities. This emphasizes the importance of differentiating between these subtypes for developing targeted therapies and refining clinical trial approaches.
