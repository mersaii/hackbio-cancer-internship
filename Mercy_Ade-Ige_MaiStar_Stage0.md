**BRCA Genes and Their Role in Biomarker Discovery**

“BRCA” is an abbreviation for “BReast CAncer gene.”  Both males and females have these genes which normally work to repair DNA and are involved in cell growth and division. There are two primary types of BRCA genes: BRCA1 (Located on chromosome 17),  and BRCA2 (Found on chromosome 13) (_National Cancer Institute, 2022_).

BRCA1 and BRCA2 are referred to as tumor suppressor genes that play a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability by repairing DNA breaks through homologous recombination (_Moynahan, Jasin 2010_). Mutations in these genes significantly increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancers, among other types. Understanding the function and impact of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations has been instrumental in biomarker discovery, particularly for hereditary cancers (_Turnbull, Rahman, 2008_).

Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 were first identified in the 1990s, and subsequent research revealed that women carrying BRCA1 mutations have up to a 72% risk of developing breast cancer and up to a 44% risk of developing ovarian cancer by the age of 80, while the BRCA2 gene mutation carriers it is 69% and 17%, respectively. (_Chen & Parmigiani, 2007_). These discoveries have made BRCA1 and BRCA2 critical biomarkers for assessing cancer risk and have led to the development of genetic tests that can identify individuals at high risk. This information empowers individuals to make informed decisions regarding preventative measures, such as enhanced surveillance, prophylactic surgeries, or chemoprevention (_Miki et al., 1994_).

Beyond risk assessment, BRCA mutations have therapeutic implications. Tumors with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations often exhibit deficiencies in DNA repair mechanisms, rendering them more sensitive to certain types of chemotherapy, such as platinum-based drugs and PARP inhibitors (Poly ADP-Ribose Polymerase inhibitors). PARP inhibitors, such as olaparib, exploit this vulnerability by further hindering DNA repair in cancer cells, leading to cell death. This targeted approach has been a significant advancement in treating BRCA-mutated cancers and exemplifies the use of BRCA as a predictive biomarker for therapy response (_Bryant et al., 2005; Farmer et al., 2005_).

Furthermore, ongoing research has indicated that BRCA mutations might also increase the risk of prostate, pancreatic, and male breast cancers (_Thompson, Easton, 2002_). As a result, BRCA1 and BRCA2 continue to be pivotal in the evolving landscape of precision medicine, serving as both diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. The continuous research and understanding of these genes not only enhance cancer treatment but also improve personalized medicine approaches (_Turnbull, Rahman, 2008_).
